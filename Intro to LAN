Local Area Network (LAN) Topologies

Topology is just name referring to the design of how a network would like.

=> Star Topology
Devices are individually connected via a central networking device such as a switch or hub.
Most Common - Reliable & Scalable
But more Expensive

=> Bus Topology
Devices relie on single connection know as backbone cable.
Prone to becoming slow and bottlenecked.
Difficult to troubleshoot.
Easy to setup and Cost-efficiet.
If Cable breaks, we cannot transmit data.

=> Ring Topology
AKA Token topology.
They are connected in a loop.
No Bottlenecks. 
Device sends its own data first.
Not much effiect coz data has to travel so many devices to reach the destination.
