Local Area Network (LAN) Topologies

Introducing LAN Topologies

Topology is just name referring to the design of how a network would like.


=> Star Topology
Devices are individually connected via a central networking device such as a switch or hub.
Most Common - Reliable & Scalable
But more Expensive


=> Bus Topology
Devices relie on single connection know as backbone cable.
Prone to becoming slow and bottlenecked.
Difficult to troubleshoot.
Easy to setup and Cost-efficiet.
If Cable breaks, we cannot transmit data.


=> Ring Topology
AKA Token topology.
They are connected in a loop.
No Bottlenecks. 
Device sends its own data first.
Not much effiect coz data has to travel so many devices to reach the destination.


=> Switch
1. Switches aggregate and connect multiple devices in a network through ports of varying numbers (4, 8, 16, 24, 32, 64).
2. Switches efficiently manage network traffic by sending packets only to the intended device, reducing overall congestion.
3. Switches are ideal for larger networks like businesses or schools where numerous devices need to be connected.
4. Switches are more advanced than hubs/repeaters, keeping track of device connections and optimizing data transmission.
5. Connecting switches and routers in a network enhances redundancy, ensuring reliability by providing multiple data paths in case of a failure.


=> Router
1. Routers connect and pass data between different networks.
2. Routing is the process of establishing a path for data to travel across networks.
3. Routers are essential when devices are connected by multiple paths, ensuring successful data delivery.
4. The term "router" comes from its primary function of routing data between networks.
5. Routing is crucial for efficient communication across interconnected networks.


A Primer on Subnetting

1. **Subnetting Overview:**
   - Subnetting involves dividing a network into smaller segments to efficiently manage and organize network resources.

2. **Purpose of Subnetting:**
   - In a business setting, subnetting helps categorize departments like Accounting, Finance, and Human Resources, ensuring proper data routing.

3. **IP Address Components:**
   - IP addresses consist of four octets. Subnet masks, also represented by four bytes, are used to define network structures.

4. **Types of IP Addresses in Subnets:**
   - Network Address: Identifies the start of a network (e.g., 192.168.1.0).
   - Host Address: Identifies devices within a subnet (e.g., 192.168.1.100).
   - Default Gateway: Special address for sending data to other networks (e.g., 192.168.1.254).

5. **Subnetting in Practice:**
   - Small networks (e.g., home) often use a single subnet, while businesses employ subnetting for efficient management of numerous devices.

6. **Benefits of Subnetting:**
   - Efficiency, Security, and Full Control are key advantages of subnetting.
  
7. **Security Example:**
   - Subnetting enables the segregation of networks in locations like cafes, separating employee devices from the public hotspot while maintaining connectivity to larger networks like the Internet.


The ARP Protocol:
1. **ARP Protocol Overview:**
   - ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) associates MAC addresses with IP addresses on a network, allowing devices to identify each other.

2. **Device Identifiers:**
   - Devices have both MAC and IP addresses, and ARP helps link them together.

3. **Communication Process:**
   - Devices broadcast ARP requests to find the MAC address associated with a specific IP address on the network.

4. **Cache Storage:**
   - Each device maintains an ARP cache, storing the MAC addresses of other devices on the network.

5. **ARP Messages:**
   - ARP protocol uses two messages:
      - ARP Request: Broadcast to inquire about the MAC address for a given IP.
      - ARP Reply: Sent in response to an ARP request, confirming the association between IP and MAC addresses.

6. **Mapping Identifiers:**
   - ARP works by mapping IP addresses to MAC addresses, creating associations stored in device caches.

7. **Cache Entry:**
   - Upon receiving an ARP reply, the requesting device stores the association in its cache as an ARP entry.

8. **Communication Initiation:**
   - Devices use ARP to discover and communicate with other devices on the network, ensuring effective data exchange.


The DHCP Protocol

1. **DHCP Protocol Overview:**
   - DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) automatically assigns IP addresses to devices on a network, streamlining the configuration process.

2. **Address Assignment:**
   - Devices can have IP addresses assigned manually or automatically through DHCP.

3. **DHCP Discover:**
   - When a device connects to a network without a manually assigned IP, it sends a DHCP Discover request to identify DHCP servers.

4. **DHCP Offer:**
   - The DHCP server responds with a DHCP Offer, providing an available IP address for the device.

5. **DHCP Request:**
   - The device accepts the offered IP address by sending a DHCP Request to the DHCP server.

6. **DHCP ACK:**
   - The DHCP server acknowledges the request with a DHCP ACK, allowing the device to use the assigned IP address.

7. **Automatic IP Configuration:**
   - DHCP simplifies network setup by automating the IP address assignment process, enhancing efficiency.

8. **Dynamic IP Allocation:**
   - DHCP dynamically allocates IP addresses, ensuring optimal utilization of available addresses on the network.
