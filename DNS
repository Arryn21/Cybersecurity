**DNS (Domain Name System) in Detail:**

**What is DNS?**
DNS (Domain Name System) is a system that translates user-friendly domain names into IP addresses, allowing devices on the internet to communicate. It simplifies the process of accessing websites by replacing complex IP addresses with easy-to-remember domain names.

**Domain Hierarchy:**

**TLD (Top-Level Domain):**
- The rightmost part of a domain name, like .com in tryhackme.com.
- Two types: gTLD (Generic Top Level Domain) and ccTLD (Country Code Top Level Domain).
- Examples: .com (gTLD), .co.uk (ccTLD).

**Second-Level Domain:**
- Preceding the TLD in a domain name, like tryhackme in tryhackme.com.
- Limited to 63 characters + TLD, using a-z, 0-9, and hyphens.

**Subdomain:**
- Situated on the left side of the Second-Level Domain, separated by periods.
- Limited to 63 characters, using a-z, 0-9, and hyphens, with a total domain name length of 253 characters or less.

**DNS Record Types:**

**A Record:**
- Resolves to IPv4 addresses (e.g., 104.26.10.229).

**AAAA Record:**
- Resolves to IPv6 addresses (e.g., 2606:4700:20::681a:be5).

**CNAME Record:**
- Resolves to another domain name, used for aliases or subdomains.

**MX Record:**
- Resolves to email server addresses with priority flags for handling domain emails.

**TXT Record:**
- Free text field storing text-based data, often used for email server authorization or domain ownership verification.

**What happens when you make a DNS request:**
1. Local cache check on your computer for recent lookups.
2. If not found, Recursive DNS Server (provided by ISP or chosen by the user) is queried.
3. Recursive DNS Server either returns the result from its cache or starts the lookup process.
4. Root DNS servers redirect to the correct TLD server.
5. TLD server provides information on authoritative servers for the domain.
6. Authoritative DNS server holds and provides the required DNS records.
7. The response is sent back through Recursive DNS Server to the client, with caching based on TTL.




**Command Line tool: nslookup**

1. **Querying A Record for website.thm:**
   ```bash
   nslookup --type=A website.thm
   ```

   Output:
   ```
   Non-authoritative answer:
   Name: website.thm
   Address: 10.10.10.10
   ```

2. **Querying CNAME Record for shop.website.thm:**
   ```bash
   nslookup --type=CNAME shop.website.thm
   ```

   Output:
   ```
   Non-authoritative answer:
   shop.website.thm canonical name = shops.myshopify.com
   ```

3. **Querying MX Record for website.thm:**
   ```bash
   nslookup --type=MX website.thm
   ```

   Output:
   ```
   Non-authoritative answer:
   website.thm mail exchanger = 30 alt4.aspmx.l.google.com      >> 30 is numerical priority value
   ```

4. **Querying TXT Record for website.thm:**
   ```bash
   nslookup --type=TXT website.thm
   ```

   Output:
   ```
   Non-authoritative answer:
   website.thm text = "THM{7012BBA60997F35A9516C2E16D2944FF}"
   ```

These commands allow you to perform DNS queries for different record types on the specified domain names. Note that the `--type` flag is used to specify the type of DNS record you want to query.


**DNS Record TTL (Time To Live):**
- Specifies how long a DNS record should be cached locally.
  
**Types of DNS Servers:**
- Recursive DNS Server: Provided by ISPs, handles DNS queries on behalf of clients.
- Authoritative DNS Server: Holds and provides DNS records for a specific domain.
