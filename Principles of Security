=>  The CIA Triad

1. **CIA Triad Overview:**
   - The CIA triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability) is a foundational information security model used in developing security policies, emphasizing the continuous cycle of these three elements.

2. **Historical Significance:**
   - Originating in 1998, the CIA triad extends beyond cybersecurity, addressing information security in various contexts like filing and record storage.

3. **Continuous Cycle:**
   - Unlike traditional models, the CIA triad is a continuous cycle where the three elements overlap, and if one is compromised, the others become ineffective.

4. **Confidentiality:**
   - Protects data from unauthorized access and misuse, ensuring sensitive information is accessible only to authorized parties, illustrated through examples like HR records and government sensitivity classifications.

5. **Integrity:**
   - Ensures information accuracy and consistency, preventing unauthorized changes, with defenses like access control, authentication, hash verifications, and digital signatures.

6. **Availability:**
   - Focuses on data accessibility for authorized users, crucial for organizations with benchmarks like 99.99% uptime, achieved through reliable hardware, redundant technology, and robust security protocols.

7. **Holistic Security Policy:**
   - An effective security policy must address all three elements of the CIA triad, as any compromise in one can impact the overall security posture of the system or organization.

=>  Principles of Priviledges

1. **Access Management Overview:**
   - Managing levels of access in an information technology system is crucial, based on an individual's role and the sensitivity of stored information.

2. **Factors Determining Access:**
   - Access levels are determined by an individual's role/function within the organization and the sensitivity of the stored information.

3. **Key Concepts:**
   - Two key concepts for access management are Privileged Identity Management (PIM) and Privileged Access Management (PAM).

4. **Privileged Identity Management (PIM):**
   - Translates a user's organizational role into an access role on a system, focusing on defining the level of access based on the user's function.

5. **Privileged Access Management (PAM):**
   - Manages the privileges associated with a system's access role, encompassing more than just assigning access, including security policies, password management, auditing, and reducing attack surfaces.

6. **Principle of Least Privilege:**
   - Users should be granted the minimum privileges necessary for their duties, ensuring trust in their actions and minimizing potential security risks.

7. **PAM's Comprehensive Scope:**
   - Beyond access assignment, PAM includes enforcing security policies, managing passwords, auditing practices, and reducing the system's vulnerability to potential attacks.

8. **Trust and Accountability:**
   - The principle of least privilege and effective access management contribute to creating a trustworthy environment where users are accountable for their actions.

=>  Security Models

**Bell-La Padula Model (Confidentiality):**
- **Objective:** Achieve confidentiality in information systems.
- **Rule:** "No write down, no read up."
- **Advantages:**
  - Aligns with hierarchical organizational structures.
  - Simple to implement and understand.
  - Proven success in governmental and military organizations.
- **Disadvantages:**
  - Users may be aware of the existence of objects without access.
  - Requires a high level of trust within the organization.
- **Context:** Effective for organizations with a well-established hierarchy and trusted members, commonly used in government and military settings.

**Biba Model (Integrity):**
- **Objective:** Achieve data integrity in information systems.
- **Rule:** "No write up, no read down."
- **Advantages:**
  - Simple implementation.
  - Resolves limitations of the Bell-La Padula model by addressing both confidentiality and data integrity.
- **Disadvantages:**
  - Many levels of access and objects, making oversight possible.
  - May result in operational delays, such as in healthcare settings.
- **Context:** Suitable for situations where integrity is prioritized over confidentiality, like in software development where developers only need access to relevant code.

Both models are security models used to enforce access controls and align with the principles of the CIA triad, emphasizing the need for confidentiality (Bell-La Padula) or integrity (Biba) in information systems.
